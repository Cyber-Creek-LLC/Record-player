# Record-player
Record Player is made ontop of SudhanPlayz's and DarrenOfficial's work from [their github](https://github.com/SudhanPlayz/Discord-MusicBot)

Rigt now this is a work in progress. I can't promise code pulled from main instead of published releases will work

## ðŸš§ | Prerequisites

- [Node.js 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Lavalink Server](https://code.darrennathanael.com/how-to-lavalink)
- You'll need to run `npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy`. to initialized the slash commands. _You can do this on your pc
  locally_

> NOTE: Lavalink is needed for music functionality. You need to have a working Lavalink server to make the bot work. This is why I left my publicly accessible Lavalink server in the config
